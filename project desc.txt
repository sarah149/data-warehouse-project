Project Description



A major airline company decided to hire you in order to assist the executive management to analyze their current business processes and 
expand the company by discovering new opportunities.

Executives decided that the first deliverable should focus on the flight activity in order to ensure good ongoing business process.
The marketing department wants to analyze what flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers take, 
what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade,
how they earn and redeem their frequent flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions,
how long their overnight stays are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum, aluminum, or titanium status
